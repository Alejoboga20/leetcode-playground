# Leetcode-playground

This repository was created to practice leet code exercises using JavaScript/TypeScript.

## How to run

If the exercise is written in JavaScript, you can run it using node:

```bash
$ node [file-name].js
```

If the exercise is written in TypeScript, you can run it using ts-node:

```bash
$ ts-node [file-name].ts
```

## Concepts applied

- Loops: `for`, `while`, `for of`
- Array methods: `every`
